Command term	Definition
Annotate	Add brief notes to a diagram or graph.
Apply	Use knowledge and understanding in response to a given situation or real circumstances. Use an idea, equation, principle, theory or law in relation to a given problem or issue. (See also “Use”.)
Calculate	Obtain a numerical answer showing the relevant stages in the working.
Comment	Give a judgment based on a given statement or result of a calculation.
Construct	Display information in a diagrammatic or logical form.
Demonstrate	Make clear by reasoning or evidence, illustrating with examples or practical application.
Derive	Manipulate a mathematical relationship to give a new equation or relationship.
Describe	Give a detailed account or picture of a situation, event, pattern or process.
Discuss	Offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
Draw	Represent by means of a labelled, accurate diagram or graph, using a pencil. A ruler (straight edge) should be used for straight lines. Diagrams should be drawn to scale. Graphs should have points correctly plotted (if appropriate) and joined in a straight line or smooth curve.
Estimate	Obtain an approximate value for an unknown quantity.
Explain	Give a detailed account including reasons or causes. (See also “Justify”.)
Identify	Provide an answer from a number of possibilities. Recognize and state briefly a distinguishing fact or feature.
Justify	Give valid reasons or evidence to support an answer or conclusion. (See also “Explain”.)
Label	Add title, labels or brief explanation(s) to a diagram or graph.
Measure	Obtain a value for a quantity.
Organize	Put ideas and information into a proper or systematic order.
Plot	Mark the position of points on a diagram.
Predict	Give an expected result of an upcoming action or event.
Prove	Use a sequence of logical steps to obtain the required result in a formal way.
Select	Choose from a list or group.
Show	Give the steps in a calculation or derivation.
Sketch	Represent by means of a diagram or graph (labelled as appropriate). The sketch should give a general idea of the required shape or relationship, and should include relevant features.
Solve	Obtain the answer(s) using algebraic and/or numerical and/or graphical methods.
State	Give a specific name, value or other brief answer without explanation or calculation.
Suggest	Propose a solution, hypothesis or other possible answer.
Trace	Follow and record the action of an algorithm.
Use	Apply knowledge or rules to put theory into practice. (See also “Apply”.)
Verify	Provide evidence that validates the result.
Write down	Obtain the answer(s), usually by extracting information. Little or no calculation is required. Working does not need to be shown.
