                    relationships with built and natural environments, from the perspective of the world as a whole.
                <p>For individuals and societies, global interactions focuses on the interdependence of the larger human
                    community, including the many ways that people come into conflict with and cooperate with each other,
                    and live together in a highly interconnected world to share finite resources.</p></span></td>

                    of <strong>Time, place and space </strong>refers to the absolute or relative position of people, objects and ideas. Time, place and space
                    focuses on how we construct and use our understanding of location (“where” and “when”).
                    <p>For individuals and societies, time is not simply the measurement of years or time periods but is
                        a continuum of significant events of the past, present and future. Place and space are complex
                        concepts, the definitions of which are fluid. Place is socially constructed and can be explored in terms
                        of constraints and opportunities afforded by location. Places have value and meaning defined by
                        humans. Space relates to where and why places and landscapes are located. This concept also includes the
                        social, economic, and political processes that interact through or across space, resulting in
                        patterns and networks arising, such as migration or trade flows. Challenges related to
                        “place and space” can be understood on multiple scales (including local, regional,

                    least two alternatives, knowing that in selecting one item, we will have to go without the other
                    (for example if we buy a camera, we cannot also buy a phone with the same money). Because of scarcity
                    (unlimited needs and wants being met by limited resources) we must make choices about which needs
                    and wants to meet with the resources we have. We break economic choice down into three more
                    specific questions:
                        <p>
                            i. What products should we make and how much of each product should we produce?<br>

Products that we use to directly meet our needs and wants are called consumer goods (for example, a television meets the desire for entertainment). Alternatives to consumption include investment and conservation. In investment, products are produced and can then be used to make other goods and services, rather than being immediately consumed. In conservation, production is avoided in order to preserve resources. Both investment and conservation allow for the possibility of higher consumption in the future. The proper combination of consumption, investment and conservation is a question for debate.</span>

                <td class="tooltip">Equity<span class="tooltiptext green">Equity involves concerns about fairness and justice. A major issue of equity is that of distribution of an economy’s products. Those who have more income and wealth are able to consume more products, and if differences in consumption are large enough, extremes of inequity or unfairness may result. What constitutes a fair or equitable distribution of consumption is a question for debate.</span>

                    encompasses local, national and global repercussions and expectations for our “shrinking” world.
                    <p>Economic globalization is the increasing integration of national economies so that resources,
                        products and information flow more freely across borders. Globalization is an ongoing process
                        that can accelerate, slow down, or even be reversed. Currently, many arrangements exist between
                        countries that increase economic integration to varying degrees (that is various types of trading blocs).
                        Globalization can be slowed or reversed when governments or other groups take actions to limit
                        the movement of resources, products or information across borders. This can happen for many
                        reasons, including but not limited to: war, a desire to protect domestic industries or a
                        desire to collect taxes on imports.</p></span>

It can occur as a result of an increase in the quantity of a society’s resources or from more efficient use of existing resources. Whether or not economic growth leads to development (increased well-being for all persons in the economy) depends on what products are produced and how they are distributed.</span>

                <td class="tooltip">Model<span class="tooltiptext blue">Models are simplified simulations of certain aspects of the economy. Models are necessary because the complexity of a real economy makes it difficult to control the necessary variables in order to run experiments. When we construct economic models, we face the challenges of accounting for the complexity of the real economy and the fact that the behaviour of human beings can be unpredictable.</span>

When people cannot meet their basic needs for survival, such as clothing, food and shelter, they are living in poverty. However, some argue that an adequate level of consumption goes beyond basic necessities, and includes things like education and health care. Therefore, the level of consumption below which poverty occurs is a question for debate.</span>

                        to produce, how to produce it, and who gets the goods that are produced. Power can be more
                        centralized, as in a command economy where economic choices are made by the government,
                        or monopoly/oligopoly situations where economic choices are made by a few large firms.
                        Power can also be decentralized, as in a free market economy where many firms and consumers
                        share power.</p></span>

                <td class="tooltip">Resources<span class="tooltiptext red">Resources are the things we use to make the products that meet our needs and wants. Economists also call them factors of production and place them in four general categories: land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship/management. Entrepreneurs combine land, labour and capital in different ways in order to produce different goods and services. For example, the owner (entrepreneur) of a fruit and vegetable store combines fruits and vegetables (natural resources/land) with the building in which the store is located (capital) and his or her work and that of his or her employees (labour) to provide a product to consumers (fruit and vegetables available in a convenient location).</span>

                <td class="tooltip">Scarcity<span class="tooltiptext red">A good is scarce when the demand for it is greater than the supply at a price of zero. Charging prices for goods helps us address the problem of scarcity. Scarcity arises from the fact that our needs and wants are unlimited, while the resources available to meet those needs and wants are limited. This forces us to choose which wants and needs to satisfy and which not to satisfy. The wants and needs we do not satisfy represent the costs for those that we do. For example, if we choose to use our resources to make televisions rather than books, then the cost of the televisions is the books we could not make after having used our resources on televisions. This economic understanding of cost is often called “opportunity cost”.</span>
                </td>
                <td class="tooltip">Sustainability<span class="tooltiptext red">The concept of sustainability implies
                    the notion of living within our means and it is central to an understanding of the nature of
                    interactions between environmental systems and societies.<p>Sustainability is a state in which
                        we meet our current needs and wants without hurting the ability of future generations to meet
                        theirs. Sustainability can be enhanced by conserving resources (that is not using them to produce
                        goods), finding ways to produce products more efficiently (that is using fewer resources in
                        production), or discovering new resources. Increased consumption in the present may undermine
                        sustainability unless it occurs through more efficient production that uses fewer resources to
                        produce the same products (for example, the energy needed to heat a home requires large quantities
                        of wood but relatively small quantities of natural gas, making natural gas a more sustainable
                        resource choice for this purpose).</p></span>

                    between the various participants in an economy. When people are allowed to trade freely,
                    including across national borders, overall wealth usually grows. However, the gains from this
                    increase in wealth may not be distributed equally. Trade can be limited by various factors including,
                    but not limited to: war and terrorism, natural disasters, government regulations and taxes, control
                    of markets by monopoly firms, and actions by workers such as strikes.</span>

                <td class="tooltip">Culture<span class="tooltiptext green">Culture helps shape, define and guide civilizations and individuals and it influences the relationship between them and the environment. Cultures are constituted by learned behaviours and values shared by groups and transmitted through socialization. Geographers study cultural traits of places in terms of language, customs, beliefs, dress, images, music, food and technology. Units that explore the related concept of culture could include issues of cultural diffusion, cultural contestation, and the process of consumerism.</span>

                <td class="tooltip">Disparity and equity<span class="tooltiptext green">Equity involves concerns about fairness and justice. Disparity is the uneven distribution of a given quality, indicator or resource and it can be opposed to the concept of equity. Geography is often the study of the condition or fact of being unequal—recognizing that the world around us has inequality, disproportionate opportunity and discrepancy, which, creates disparity. What causes the gap between those that have and those that have not? What does it mean “to have” and to “have not”? What is the perception of a disparity? As a related concept, disparity should have a degree of scale and harness the essential drivers of disparity: economics, opportunity, access to resources, choices, values and freedom. Inequality might be based on gender, ethnicity, age, location, citizenship and income, among other variables.</span>

                <td class="tooltip">Diversity<span class="tooltiptext blue">The point or aspect by which things differ is critical to the study of geography both in the human and physical senses. Both the human and physical world have differences that intrinsically mesh to create a planet of diversity and a unique world. Places, environments and peoples are diverse. Diversity can be investigated over time and space. The focus could be on physical or cultural diversity.</span>

It has been characterized by some geographers as a process of time–place convergence and it is characterized by an increasing interdependence among peoples and nations. The cultural, political and economic interconnectedness of the global economy is an undeniable trend that has been amplified by rapid improvements in technology and communication systems. Globalization can be simultaneously positive and negative for people and the natural environment depending on the range of changes that result and the perspective of the analyst. Globalization as a concept has also been questioned by some who have preferred to speak of processes of “westernization”, “glocalization” or “mundialization”.</span>

                <td class="tooltip">Management and intervention <span class="tooltiptext blue">Management can be defined as the human intervention in both natural and human contexts to achieve desired ends. MYP geography courses should consider the ways in which humans respond to the challenges of managing quantity and quality of resources, as well as the consequences of management. Often we see these as ways of solving problems through finding ways to preserve unique components of our lithosphere (land/waste management), hydrosphere (coastal/water management), biosphere (conservation and animal/plant/agricultural management) and atmosphere (clean air management). Management can be embedded into political geography as a related concept by looking at governance through laws or education to enable better choices. Decision-making and management are dependent on the differences in the balance of power held by different stakeholders (see related concept of power).</span>

Networks are usually composed of nodes or parts that depend upon each other; when one of these nodes or parts changes it usually affects the other parts. These individual parts of a network usually exist within a measurable hierarchical scale. In geography, the concept of networks can be explored in a vast array of sizes and level of complexity. A network can range from the populations of herbivores within a national park to all of the lakes, aquifers, rivers and streams in the Amazon Basin. Also, networks can be explored at the world systems level with the interaction between the core and the periphery. Geographers understand that most of the processes they study are not isolated phenomena but rather interconnected pieces of a greater network. Networks are intrinsically linked to the key concept of “systems” and they exist across a wide spectrum of times, places and spaces, another of our key concepts.</span>

Patterns and trends can be established at different levels of analysis or at different scales, from the local to the national and regional, to the global. Patterns and trends can also be used as important tools to help predict and anticipate geographic processes in both human and natural contexts. Patterns and trends in geography are inherently linked to the concept of “systems” and they exist across a wide spectrum of times, places and spaces, another of our key concepts.</span>

A process that is particularly important for geographers is that of development. Even though the definition of development is subject to much debate (especially regarding its indicators), it can be understood as a social, economic and political process that enables the rise in the standards of living of the population.</span>

Scale as a related concept looks at the local, regional, national and international/global framework that the subject specific content is applicable to. Use of this related concept emphasizes that challenges, problems and ideas can be analysed at one of these scales and/or the interrelation among them. There should be recognition that they do not only happen in situ but also have an effect on each other.</span>

Monarchies, republics, tribes, parliaments, presidents, dictators: these and other patterns of rule express a range of human values and reflect varied understandings of history and culture. At the heart of governance are questions about the distribution of resources, the making of laws, and the balance of power between individuals and the communities in which they live. Democratic governments are accountable to the people who choose them.</span>

This concept refers to how both individual and group perceptions of the self, form, evolve and are expressed. From a historical perspective, identity can be examined as a cause or consequence of an event, idea or process.

Ideologies can be derived from the place and space in which a group of people or a society is located. Ideologies can evolve into political, economic or social systems and these systems can impact humans in a variety of ways. For example, through the definition of certain rights and responsibilities.</span>

In order to better understand something from history, we must look at its context—those things that surround it in time and place and that give it its meaning or value. In this way, we can gain, among other things, a sense of how unique or ordinary an event or idea seems to be in comparison to other events and ideas.</span>
